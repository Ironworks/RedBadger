# Red Badger Test

## How to run the project

* The input data is contained in the 'input.txt' file. Additional test cases can be added to this file.
* To run the project open it in XCODE and run the 'RedBadger' target.
* Output can be seen in the console.

## Missing requirements

* I have not implemented a check to ensure that coordinate values are <= 50
* There is no check to ensure that the instruction string is < 100 characters

## Things to do

Given more time I would implement the following:

  * Add the missing requirements above
  * Allow the tool to accept a file containing the instructions as an input parameter
  * Implement an interactive mode
  * Add documentation comments to describe the functionality of methods
